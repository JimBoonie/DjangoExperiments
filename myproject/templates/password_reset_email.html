Hello,

A request was made to Django Boards to reset the password belonging to user {{ user.username }} and the email address {{ email }}. 

If this was you, follow the link to proceed:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thank you,

- Djangoman
